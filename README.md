## Libraries

Make sure the following python libraries are installed:

- **Requests**
```
pip3 intall requests
```
- **Beautiful Soup**
```
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 
```
- **lxml** (For xml parsing)

Alternatively you can install `bpython` which will also serve as a python interpreter that we can use. You can see that we can also check if `bs4` is installed with no errors as we import the module:
